## Quiz Review
### Question 1
2CuO + C -> 2Cu + CO2
1 Ton = 907.185 kg
907185 g CuO * 1 mol CuO / 79.54 g CuO * 1 mole C / 2 mole CuO * 12.01 g C / 1 mole C = 68493.4 g C / .95 = 72000 g
### Question 2
CxHyOz
Molar Mass = 176.1 g / mol
10.68 mg -> 16.01mg CO2 + 4.47 mg H2O

16.01 mg CO2 * 1 g / 1000 mg * 1 mol CO2 / 44 g CO2 * 1 mol C / 1 mol CO2 * 12 g C / 1 mol C * 1000 mg / 1000 g = 4.370 mg C
4.37 mg H2O * 1 g / 1000 mg * 1 mol H2O / 18 g H2O * 2 mol H / 1 mol H2O * 1.01 g / 1 mol * 1000 mg / 1000 g = .490 mg

10.68 mg - 4.370 mg C - .490 mg H = 5.82 mg O

4.370 / 10.68 = 40.92 % C
.490 / 10.68 = 4.59 % H
5.82 / 10.68 = 54.59 % C

40.92 g C * 1 mol C / 12.0 g C = 3.407 / 3.405 = 1 * 3 = 3
4.59 g H * 1 mol H / 1.01 g H = 4.54 / 3.405 = 1.33 * 3 = 4
54.49 g O * 1 mol O / 16 g O = 3.405 / 3.405 = 1 * 3 = 3

C3H4O3

Molar Mass C3H4O3 = 36 + 4 + 48 = 88 g / mol
176.1 g / 88 g / mol = 2 mol
C6H8O6
### Question 3
1.00 g NaHCO3 * 1 mol NaHCO3 / 84.0 g NaHCO3 * 1 mol / 3 mol *  192.0 g citric / mol citrict = .762 g citric acid
sod bic is limiting

1.00 Sodbi * 1 mol / 84.0 g * 3 / 3 * 44.0 g CO2 / 1 mol CO2 = .564 g CO2 is produced

1.00 - .762 = .238 g cit acid

.484 / .5237 = 92.4 %

## Chapter 4
### Solutions
Solutions are defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more pure substances.
The solvent is present in greatest abundance.
All other substances are solutes.
### Aqueous Solutions
Substances can dissolve in water by different way:
 • Ionic Compounds dissolve by dissociation, where water surrounds the separated
 ions.
 • Molecular compounds interact with water, but most do NOT dissociate
 • Some molecular substances react with water when they dissolve
### Electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes
An electrolyte is a substance that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water
A nonelectrolyte may dissolve in water, but it does not dissociate into ions
when it does so.
### Electrolytes
Pure water does not conduct electricity, but the salt does.
A strong electrolyte dissociates completely when dissolved in water.
### Solubility of ionic compounds
A list of solubility rules is used to decide what combination of ions will
dissolve

### Ways to write Metathesis Reactions
 1. Molecuar equation
 2. Complete ionic equation
 3. Net ionic equation
### Molecular Equation
### Complete ionic equation
In the complete ionic equation, all strong electrolytes (strong acids, strong
bases, and soluble ionic salts) are dissociated into their ions.
### Net Ionic Equation
To form the net ionic equation, cross out anything that does not change from the
left side of the equation to the right.
### Writing Net Ionic Equation
 1. Write a balanced molecular equation
 2. Dissociate all strong electrolytes
 3. Cross out anything that remains the same on both sides of the equation
 4. Write the net ionic equation with the things that remai

## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Oxidations is the loss of electrons
Gain of electrons is reduction
One cannot occur without the other
The reactions are ofter called redox reactions
## Oxidation Numbers
## Rules to Assign Oxidation Numbers
Elements in their elemental form have an oxidation number of zero
The oxidation number of monatomic ion is the same as its charge
Nonmetals tend to have negative oxidation numbers, although some are positive in
certain compounds or ions.
Oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, except in the peroxide ion, in which it
has an oxidation number of -1
Hydrogen is -1 when bonded to a metal, and +1 when bonded to a nonmetal
Nonmetals tend to have negative oxidation numbers, although some are positive in
certain compounds or ions.
• Fluorine has always has an oxidation number of -1
• The other halogens have an oxidation number of -1 when they are negative; they
  can have positive oxidation numbers
The sum of oxidation nmbers in a neutral compound is always zero.

## Molarity
The quantity of solute in a solution can matter to a chemist
We call the amount dissolved its concentration
